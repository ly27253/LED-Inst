# NWPU_Apple_Seg_Data

**NWPU_Apple_Seg_Data** is a high-quality apple instance segmentation dataset collected in an orchard in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, China. The orchard features a spacing layout of 3.5 m (rows) and 1.2 m (trees). Images were captured during the harvest season (September–October 2023) using a ZED stereo camera (1280 × 720 resolution) mounted on a laptop.

To simulate the viewpoint of robotic harvesting, the camera was positioned 50–80 cm from fruiting branches and used to collect data between 08:00 and 17:00 each day. The dataset captures rich field variability, including differences in illumination (high-intensity, overexposed, low-light, and normal), viewpoints (upward, top-down, and frontal), and time of day (morning, midday, and dusk).

## 📌 Data Samples
Below are representative examples showing the diversity of lighting, viewpoints, and orchard conditions:

Over 2,000 raw images were acquired, and 1,486 valid samples were retained after manual inspection. All instance masks were annotated using the Segment Anything model for high-quality segmentation.

## 📌 Example of Annotations
Instance segmentation masks were generated using SAM; an example is shown below:
