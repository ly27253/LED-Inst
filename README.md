# NWPU_Apple_Seg_Data

**NWPU_Apple_Seg_Data** is a high-quality apple instance segmentation dataset collected in an orchard in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, China. The orchard features a spacing layout of 3.5 m (rows) and 1.2 m (trees). Images were captured during the harvest season (September–October 2023) using a ZED stereo camera (1280 × 720 resolution) mounted on a laptop.

To simulate the viewpoint of robotic harvesting, the camera was positioned 50–80 cm from fruiting branches and used to collect data between 08:00 and 17:00 each day. The dataset captures rich field variability, including differences in illumination (high-intensity, overexposed, low-light, and normal), viewpoints (upward, top-down, and frontal), and time of day (morning, midday, and dusk).

Over 2,000 raw images were acquired, and 1,486 valid samples were retained after manual inspection. All instance masks were annotated using the Segment Anything model for high-quality segmentation. The dataset is divided into training and validation subsets in an 8:2 ratio to support model development and evaluation.

**NWPU_Apple_Seg_Data** provides a diverse and realistic benchmark for apple instance segmentation, suitable for research in agricultural robotics, fruit detection, yield estimation, and autonomous harvesting.
